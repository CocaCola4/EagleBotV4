# EagleBotV4
Here is the 4th Generation of EagleBot Code. This update features new embeds for commands, colors based on roles, logging, and error feedback with a check or x when you execute a command. If there is an error, it'll  send it in the channel then delete it shortly. Contact me on twitter @TheMegaEagle or on discord @TheMegaEagle#9909.

## Setup
Along with EagleBotV3, NodeJS will be required to be installed. You can do this at https://nodejs.org. The version you install is your preference. After you do that, please `cd` into the directory you would like to set the bot up in. After you do that, run `npm init`. You can leave all of the options blank or at your preference, except for entry point. Entry point must be set to `bot.js`. After that, you may run `npm install --save discord.js` to get the JavaScript Discord API installed. After that, feel free to edit the `bot.js` file!

## Whats happening to EagleBot?
Well, if you follow my Discord Development, you would know that EagleBot is being discontinued soon. This is in favor of IceBot, a new Discord bot by TatraTram#3098:https://bit.ly/2Sep8Cx. AquaBot will be continuing most of EagleBots features in a more modern way.

## Commands
All commands are preloaded, except they are disabled with comments. To enable them, just remove the comments. This is to avoid confusion with less experienced developers.
